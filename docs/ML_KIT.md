Just dumping a few things I should not forget to add to the doc:

- see step 3 @ https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/android/recognize-text
- For Cloud processing, enable the Vision API and upgrade your Firebase project to "Blaze" (pay as you go)

Known issues:
- Detecting faces from still images doesn't currently work on iOS (detection from the camera stream works though)
